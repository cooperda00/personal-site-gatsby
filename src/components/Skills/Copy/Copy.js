      <p>
        I value being able to build projects that are scalable, easily
        extendable and have an easily navigable codebase. Therefore it makes
        sense for me to build in a modular, component-based fashion using React
        and Redux. I like to support the front-end with Firebase services or a
        headless CMS like Contentful on the backend. Recently I have been using
        Gatsby a lot and find it perfect for most of my needs as a developer.
